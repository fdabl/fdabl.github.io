We are in a [climate emergency](https://fabiandablander.com/Climate-Impacts.html). And it is getting late.

We thus need to act swiftly and with resolve, yet governments around the world are either moving [too slowly or in the wrong direction](https://climateactiontracker.org/countries/). To put pressure on them and force change, we need to build the largest, most inclusive social movement in history. Climate action has to move from something that others do to something that [we all engage in](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/dec/04/more-than-1000-climate-scientists-urge-public-to-become-activists). Each and everyone of us has a role to play — this is humanity's decisive decade.

Education is a vital first step. Personally, I became truly aware of the [enormous scale and urgency](https://fabiandablander.com/Climate-Impacts.html) of the crisis only recently, starting in the summer of 2020, when the ongoing Covid disaster compelled me to take a closer look at the (scientific) literature. Below are some resources that I have found useful on my journey so far; note that they are in no particular order. Some of the things I have learned are summarized in a [recent talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6NtBz1q4ug).

I will try to add to this list going forward, and I hope that some of it will be useful to you.

- [The Doppelganger](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/138505710-doppelganger)

    - Kevin Young draws on the successes of past movements, including the abolition of slavery, civil rights, and clean air regulations, to argue for a shift in focus for the climate movement: disrupting economic elites to achieve change because, in the words of Martin Luther King Jr, "the political power structure listens to the economic power structure." For a concise summary of the main arguments, see [this paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-023-02507-y).
- [Levers of Power](https://www.versobooks.com/books/3181-levers-of-power)
    - This extremely well-researched book is nothing short of eye-opening, detailing how big corporations use their structural power over the economy — chiefly derived from their control of the investment of capital — to exert enormous influence on political decision-making. The book also describes how past social movements have disrupted business in order to achieve progress reform. Highly recommended!
- [Power in Movement](https://www.cambridge.org/nl/universitypress/subjects/politics-international-relations/comparative-politics/power-movement-social-movements-and-contentious-politics-4th-edition)

    - This highly stimulating, unabashedly Marxist book argues that we should center production, not consumption; criticizes the climate movement, whose members primarily come from the [professional-managerial class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional%E2%80%93managerial_class); and presents an alternative approach that focuses on building working class power. Well worth a close read!

    - Short, US-centric book arguing that only a sustained, heightened perception of risk can mobilize enough people to bring about systemic change. The arguments sometimes feel underdeveloped, and people well-versed in the climate movement may prefer to directly read Fisher's [academic](https://www.nature.com/articles/s44168-022-00011-8) [work](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0735275119888247). 
- [A Bigger Picture](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56817598-a-bigger-picture)
    - In this powerful memoir, Vanessa Nakate recounts how she became an activist, only to be cropped out by Western media.

- [Burnout](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/209250783-burnout)
    - Drawing on numerous past struggles, this book critically discusses the various emotional experiences — including melancholia, depression, and exhaustion — associated with political defeat. At times extremely illuminating, at others a little too academic.
- [Change](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53369466-change)
    - The adoption of new behaviours and social norms does not spread by simple contagion, like viruses, but by complex contagion. An insightful and highly readable book on the implications of this fact for change.

    - A collection of excellent essays, with topics ranging from BP's devastating oil spill in 2010 to the ascent of the Green New Deal in 2019. As Greta Thunberg notes, Naomi Klein is "the great chronicler of our age, an inspirer of generations."
- [Ending Fossil Fuels](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59495922-ending-fossil-fuels)
    - In this informative and thought-provoking book, sociologist Holly Jean Buck shows why the framing of "net zero" is problematic; illustrates the multiple dimensions of phasing out fossil fuels; and provides suggestions of how we can end them before they end us.

    - This extremely well researched and marvellously written book is the best guide to understanding our [completely broken](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/sep/14/global-farm-subsidies-damage-people-planet-un-climate-crisis-nature-inequality) agricultural system, and how to fix it. One cannot imagine a better companion to explore the many complexities of feeding the world without devouring the planet than [George Monbiot](https://www.theguardian.com/profile/georgemonbiot). God bless him!
- [The Future We Choose](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52117860-the-future-we-choose)
    - Christiana Figueres and Tom Rivett-Carnac, key architects of the Paris agreement, outline two futures and sketch how we can get onto the much better one.
- [Not the End of the World](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/145624737)
    - Provides a good overview and historical context of our various environmental problems, but also erects several straw men and mischaracterizes climate activist groups and degrowth. I hope that the effect of motivating people through optimism [is greater](https://youtu.be/XOg6U68PWAY?t=6145) than the damaging effect it might have in perpetuating the status quo. Worth a read!
- [The New Climate War](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53441709-the-new-climate-war?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=pe4Sd1PDfO&rank=1)

  - Short and concise guide to the history, logic, and dangers of the corporation. At times a bit too polemic, but well researched and referenced. Nicely complements watching The Corporation [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nFQDQMJARs) and [II](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPcHjF8RmYY).
- [Saudi America](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/39028544-saudi-america)
    - The shale revolution has [transformed the US](https://www.iea.org/news/the-us-shale-revolution-has-reshaped-the-energy-landscape-at-home-and-abroad-according-to-latest-iea-policy-review) into the world's top oil and gas producer and [a leading exporter](https://twitter.com/WhiteHouse/status/1501947054259531782) of fossil fuels. Bethany McLean tells the extraordinary story of this deeply worrying development and the people behind it in this short book.
- [How the World Really Works](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58784471-how-the-world-really-works)
    - Filled with insightful statistics, astute observations, and original calculations, this is a good book to better understand the challenges of (rapid) decarbonization. Ignoring the author's smugness may at times be difficult, however.
- [Merchants of Doubt](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7799004-merchants-of-doubt)
    - This is one of the best and most sobering books I have ever read. Beware of science (and scientists) motivated by ideology.

- [Thinking in Systems](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3828902-thinking-in-systems)
    - "There’s so much talk about the system. And so little understanding." This book is a real classic, thought-provoking and full of insights. It also includes Donella Meadows's [famous essay on leverage points](https://donellameadows.org/archives/leverage-points-places-to-intervene-in-a-system/). A book that deserves to be re-read from time to time.
- [Earth4All](https://www.earth4all.life/)
    - 50 years after *Limits to Growth*, this book uses a novel system dynamics model to explore what turnarounds — from reducing inequality to transforming the food system — are required to move from our current *Too Little, Too Late* scenario towards the *Giant Leap*. It is a masterclass in using models to narratively explore possible futures, and provides many concrete policy proposals that are worth [exploring in greater depth](https://www.earth4all.life/publications).
- [Think Like a Commoner](http://thinklikeacommoner.com/)
    - There is the market and then there is the state, right? No! There is also the vast space occupied by the commons. David Bollier, who also runs a [great podcast](https://david-bollier.simplecast.com/), provides a well-written and indeed mind-expanding introduction to the commons.

- [Post Growth: Life after Capitalism](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/55404479-post-growth)
    - Lyrical meditation hinting at what the economy — and life — could be like, told through biographical sketches of giants such as John Stuart Mill, Hannah Arendt, and Wangari Maathai. Less concrete than I had hoped given the title, but insightful nonetheless.
- [Technofeudalism](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/75560037-techno-feudalism)
    - Highly stimulating economic history and analysis of what may have killed capitalism, helping us to understand the new Cold War and develop strategies for achieving a better life for all.
- [The Future is Degrowth](https://www.versobooks.com/books/3989-the-future-is-degrowth)
    - This book provides a thorough treatment of the many aspects of degrowth. It moves from a powerful analysis and critique of economic growth to a vision of a good life for all, and includes proposals for how to get there from here. Highly recommended!

- [Birnam Wood](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/60784757)

- [The Invention of Nature](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/23995249)

- [Climate change isn't everything](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/178154132-climate-change-isn-t-everything)
    - It is crucial to avoid a myopic, single-issue focus that puts climate change above all other issues. That leads to bad policy. Climate change is indeed not everything. [But it is quite a lot](https://simonmaxwell.net/blog/climate-change-isnt-everything-by-mike-hulme.html), and a lot more than Hulme makes it out to be in this occasionally insightful but overall rather misguided book.
- [How Fascism Works](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38255329-how-fascism-works)
    - An insightful and concise book describing ten characteristics of fascist politics.

    - George Monbiot teams up with Peter Hutchison, the acclaimed filmmaker of [Requiem for the American Dream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEnv5I8Aq4I), to deliver a powerful and concise exploration of the wretched yet dominant ideology of our time: neoliberalism. Essential reading for anyone seeking to understand the forces shaping our world.

- [LN3: Teachings of the Anishinaabe Resistance](https://www.stopline3.org/ln3film-video)

- [Cowspiracy](https://www.cowspiracy.com/)
    - Motivated me to look into the environmental footprint of meat and dairy in 2015, which caused me to switch to a plant-based diet. The benefits to planet and personal health are obvious — I've never looked back. Industrial agriculture alone could [blow our carbon budget](https://ourworldindata.org/food-emissions-carbon-budget), and switching to a plant-rich diet is the strongest mitigation option.
- [Seaspiracy](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14152756/)
    - Similar in spirit as *Cowspiracy*. Informative but also slightly annoying.
- [Kiss the Ground](https://kisstheground.com/)

- [Capitalism: A Love Story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cK4H79j1I4A)
    - It is always good to remind oneself about what they are getting away with. We might not have the money, but we do have the numbers. And therein lies great power.
- [The Four Horsemen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fbvquHSPJU)
    - Great selection of topics and guests. "I don't think there is anything deeper than what's on the surface. Intellectuals have to make it look complicated, that's part of their job."
- [Gasland](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mp4ELXKv-w)
    - Created on a shoestring budget, this unsettling film explores the fracking boom and the devastation it causes in US communities. Who knew that tap water could be set on fire?
- [Gasland II](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA_B-AC-pB0)
    - Devastating sequel exploring the gas industry's greenwashing, corporate lobbying, and contempt for nature and human life. "Environmentalists only ever get temporary victories, but the losses are always permanent."

- [Awake: A Dream From Standing Rock](https://awakethefilm.org/)
    - A good film about the struggle to stop the Dakota Access Pipeline and the brutality of the present.
- [Carbon Bomb: Exxon, the World Bank, & One of the Biggest Oil Discoveries of our Time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chmOgYB7DGk)
    - Insightful short film made by the fantastic German organisation [urgewald](https://urgewald.org/). Let's just say that the World Bank does not look too good in this one.
- [Coming Clean: A Demand for a Fossil Free UC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N_dq9J7mDY)
    - Great short film on the fossil fuel dependency of the University of California and the chimera of carbon offsets.

Impressing and inspiring.
- [Climate change and the rich](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7yAk5iYm_k)

    - Inspiring — yet gut-wrenching — documentary about 21 brave American youngsters suing the federal government for the greatest dereliction of duty in history.
- [Youth Unstoppable](https://www.youthunstoppable.com/)
    - Powerful documentary about the rise of the global youth climate movement, detailing developments before Fridays for Future put the youth on the map for many.
- [How to Blow Up a Pipeline](https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/how-to-blow-up-a-pipeline)
    - Based on the book of the same name, follows a group of people who come together to engage in some proper sabotage. Leaves you with an eerie feeling of things to come.
- [Iron Jawed Angels](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0338139)
    - Iron Jawed Angels details the extraordinary nonviolent direct action campaign that Alice Paul and Lucy Burns waged as part of the women's suffrage movement in the United States in the 1910s. While at times a bit anachronistic and (too) fictional, this is a great movie to watch!
- [Pride](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3169706/)
    - Beautiful and inspiring film telling the story of how the lesbian and gay community supported miners in [their 1984-1985 strike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_miners%27_strike_(1984%E2%80%9385)) and battle against Margaret Thatcher.
- [Don't Look Up](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11286314/)
    - This is not a documentary but sharp sociopolitical commentary. Two astronomers discover a comet about to hit Earth — how will society react? The film hits so close to home it is at times painful to watch; it helps you [relate to climate scientists](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/dec/29/climate-scientist-dont-look-up-madness), who have been sounding the alarm for decades. Graphs and charts have clearly not been enough; satire and humor are [welcome allies](https://twitter.com/MichaelEMann/status/1473664359536951303).
